# DEPLOY TO NETLIFY - SUPER SIMPLE

Since the CLI is being difficult, here's the EASIEST way:

## Option 1: Drag & Drop (30 seconds)
1. Open https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Open your file manager to: `/home/jgolden/pedro/panerai-carbon-navy-gauge`
3. Drag the ENTIRE folder onto the browser
4. DONE! You'll get a URL instantly

## Option 2: GitHub Deploy (2 minutes)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Choose GitHub
4. Find: `panerai-carbon-navy-gauge`
5. Click Deploy

## Option 3: Manual Terminal (if CLI works)
```bash
cd /home/jgolden/pedro/panerai-carbon-navy-gauge
netlify init  # Choose "Create new site"
netlify deploy --prod
```

The site is 100% ready - it's just static HTML/CSS/JS!
